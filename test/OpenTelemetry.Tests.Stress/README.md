* [Understanding the results](#understanding-the-results)

## Why would you need stress test

* It helps you to understand performance.
* You can keep it running for days and nights to verify stability.
* You can use it to generate lots of load to your backend system.
* You can use it with other stress tools (e.g. a memory limiter) to verify how
  your code reacts to certain resource constraints.

## Running the demo

Open a console, run the following command from the current folder:

```sh
dotnet run --framework net6.0 --configuration Release
```

Once the application started, you will see the performance number updates from
the console window title.

Use the `SPACE` key to toggle the console output, which is off by default.

Use the `ENTER` key to print the latest performance statistics.

Use the `ESC` key to exit the stress test.

The stress test metrics are exposed via
[PrometheusExporter](../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus/README.md),
which can be accessed via
[http://localhost:9184/metrics/](http://localhost:9184/metrics/):

## Writing your own stress test

Create a simple console application with the following code:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

public partial class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Stress(concurrency: 10, prometheusPort: 9184);
    }

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
    protected static void Run()
    {
        // add your logic here
    }
}
```

Add the [`Skeleton.cs`](./Skeleton.cs) file to your `*.csproj` file:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Skeleton.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Now you are ready to run your own stress test.

Some useful notes:

* You can specify the concurrency using `Stress(concurrency: {concurrency
  number})`, the default value is the number of CPU cores. Keep in mind that
  concurrency level does not equal to the number of threads.
* You can specify a local PrometheusExporter listening port using
  `Stress(prometheusPort: {port number})`, the default value is `0`, which will
  turn off the PrometheusExporter.
* You want to put `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]` on
  `Run()`, this helps to reduce extra flushes on the CPU instruction cache.
* You might want to run the stress test under `Release` mode rather than `Debug`
  mode.

## Understanding the results

* `Loops` represent the total number of `Run()` invocations that are completed.
* `Loops/Second` represents the rate of `Run()` invocations based on a small
  sliding window of few hundreds of milliseconds.
* `CPU Cycles/Loop` represents the average CPU cycles for each `Run()`
  invocation, based on a small sliding window of few hundreds of milliseconds.
