# Instruments

In the getting started document we saw a `Counter`, that's only one of the

Here is an example program that uses the following instruments

- `Histogram`
- `Async Gauge`
- `Async Counter`

```{literalinclude} ../../metrics/learning-more-instruments/Program.cs
:language: c#
:lines: 17-
```
