# OpenTelemetry .NET Diagnostic: OTEL1004

## Overview

This is an Experimental API diagnostic covering the following APIs:

* `ExemplarReservoir`
* `FixedSizeExemplarReservoir`
* `ExemplarMeasurement<T>`
* `MetricStreamConfiguration.ExemplarReservoirFactory.get`
* `MetricStreamConfiguration.ExemplarReservoirFactory.set`

Experimental APIs may be changed or removed in the future.

## Details

The OpenTelemetry Specification defines an [ExemplarReservoir
API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#exemplarreservoir)
and a mechanism for configuring `ExemplarReservoir` via the [View
API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#stream-configuration)
in the Metrics SDK.

From the specification:

> The SDK MUST provide a mechanism for SDK users to provide their own
> ExemplarReservoir implementation. This extension MUST be configurable on a
> metric View, although individual reservoirs MUST still be instantiated per
> metric-timeseries...

We are exposing these APIs experimentally until the specification declares them
stable and the maintainers are comfortable with the usability of the design and
the need for the feature.

## Provide feedback

Please provide feedback on [this issue](TODO) if you need stable support for
custom `ExemplarReservoir`s.
