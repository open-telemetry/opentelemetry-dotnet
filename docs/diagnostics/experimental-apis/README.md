# OpenTelemetry .NET Experimental APIs

This document describes experimental APIs exposed in OpenTelemetry .NET
pre-relase builds. APIs are exposed experimentally when either the OpenTelemetry
Specification has explicitly marked some feature as
[experimental](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/document-status.md)
or when the SIG members are still working through the design for a feature and
want to solicit feedback from the community.

> [!NOTE]
> Experimental APIs are exposed as `public` in pre-release builds and `internal`
in stable builds.
