# OpenTelemetry .NET Diagnostic: OTEL1003

## Overview

This is an Experimental API diagnostic covering the following API:

* `MetricStreamConfiguration.CardinalityLimit.get`
* `MetricStreamConfiguration.CardinalityLimit.set`

Experimental APIs may be changed or removed in the future.

## Details

The OpenTelemetry Specification defines the
[cardinality limit](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#configuration-1)
of a metric can be defined by the matching view.

From the specification:

> The cardinality limit for an aggregation is defined in one of three ways:
> A view with criteria matching the instrument an aggregation is created for has
> an aggregation_cardinality_limit value defined for the stream, that value
> SHOULD be used. If there is no matching view, but the MetricReader defines a
> default cardinality limit value based on the instrument an aggregation is
> created for, that value SHOULD be used. If none of the previous values are
> defined, the default value of 2000 SHOULD be used.

We are exposing these APIs experimentally until the specification declares them
stable.
