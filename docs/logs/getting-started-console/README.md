# Getting Started with OpenTelemetry .NET Logs in 5 Minutes - Console Application

First, download and install the [.NET
SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) on your computer.

Create a new console application and run it:

```sh
dotnet new console --output getting-started
cd getting-started
dotnet run
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello World!
```

Install the latest `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package:

  ```sh
  dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
  ```

Install the
[OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md)
package:

```sh
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console
```

Copy the [FoodSupplyLogs.cs](./FoodSupplyLogs.cs) and [Program.cs](./Program.cs)
files to the project folder.

Run the application again (using `dotnet run`) and you should see the log output
on the console.

Congratulations! You are now collecting logs using OpenTelemetry.

What does the above program do?

The program has a
[`LoggerFactory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.iloggerfactory)
with OpenTelemetry added as a
[LoggerProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging-providers).
This `LoggerFactory` is used to create an
[`ILogger`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger)
instance, which is then used to do the logging. [Compile-time logging source
  generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator)
is used to achieve structured logging and better performance. The logs are sent to
the `OpenTelemetryLoggerProvider`, which is configured to export logs to
`ConsoleExporter`. `ConsoleExporter` simply displays it on the console.

> **Note**
> Certain types of applications (e.g. [ASP.NET
Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core) and [.NET
Worker](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/workers)) have an
`ILogger` based logging pipeline set up by default. In such apps, enabling
OpenTelemetry should be done by adding OpenTelemetry as a provider to the
*existing* logging pipeline, and users should not create a new `LoggerFactory`
(which sets up a totally new logging pipeline). Also, obtaining `ILogger`
instance could be done differently as well. See [Example ASP.NET Core
application](../../../examples/AspNetCore/Program.cs) for an example which shows
how to add OpenTelemetry to the logging pipeline already setup by the
application.
