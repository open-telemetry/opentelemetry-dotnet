# Getting Started with OpenTelemetry .NET Logs in 5 Minutes - ASP.NET Core Application

First, download and install the [.NET
SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) on your computer.

Create a new web application:

```sh
dotnet new web -o aspnetcoreapp
cd aspnetcoreapp
```

Install the
[OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md)
and
[OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting/README.md)
packages:

```sh
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
```

Update the `Program.cs` file with the code from [Program.cs](./Program.cs).

Run the application (using `dotnet run`) and then browse to the URL shown in the
console for your application (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`). You should see the
logs output from the console:

```

Congratulations! You are now collecting logs using OpenTelemetry.

What does the above program do?

The program has cleared the default [logging
providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging-providers)
then added OpenTelemetry as a logging provider to the ASP.NET Core logging
pipeline. OpenTelemetry SDK is then configured with a
[ConsoleExporter](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md) to
export the logs to the console for demonstration purpose (note: ConsoleExporter
is not intended for production usage, other exporters such as [OTLP
Exporter](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol/README.md)
should be used instead). In addition, `OpenTelemetryLoggerOptions.IncludeScopes`
is enabled so the logs will include the [log
scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging#log-scopes).
From the console output we can see the log scopes that are coming from the
ASP.NET Core framework, and we can see logs from both our logger and the ASP.NET
Core framework loggers, as indicated by the `LogRecord.CategoryName`.

The example has demonstrated the best practice from ASP.NET Core by injecting
generic `ILogger<T>`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", (ILogger<Program> logger) =>
{
    logger.FoodPriceChanged("artichoke", 9.99);

    return "Hello from OpenTelemetry Logs!";
});
```

Following the .NET logging best practice, [compile-time logging source
generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator)
has been used across the example, which delivers high performance, structured
logging, and type-checked parameters:

```csharp
public static partial class ApplicationLogs
{
    [LoggerMessage(EventId = 1, Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = "Starting the app...")]
    public static partial void StartingApp(this ILogger logger);

    [LoggerMessage(EventId = 2, Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = "Food `{name}` price changed to `{price}`.")]
    public static partial void FoodPriceChanged(this ILogger logger, string name, double price);
}
```

For logs that occur between `builder.Build()` and `app.Run()` when injecting a
generic `ILogger<T>` is not an option, `app.Logger` is used instead:

```csharp
app.Logger.StartingApp();
```

> **Note**
> There are cases where logging is needed before the [dependency injection
(DI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)
logging pipeline is available (e.g. before `builder.Build()`) or after the DI
logging pipeline is disposed (e.g. after `app.Run()`). The common practice is to
use a separate logging pipeline by creating a `LoggerFactory` instance.
>
> Refer to the [Getting Started with OpenTelemetry .NET Logs in 5 Minutes -
Console Application](../getting-started-console/README.md) tutorial to learn
more about how to create a `LoggerFactory` instance and configure OpenTelemetry
to work with it.
