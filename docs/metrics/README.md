## Best Practices

The following tutorials have demonstrated the best practices for using metrics
with OpenTelemetry .NET:

* [Getting Started - ASP.NET Core
  Application](./getting-started-aspnetcore/README.md)
* [Getting Started - Console Application](./getting-started-console/README.md)

## Package Version

:heavy_check_mark: You should always use the
[System.Diagnostics.Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics)
APIs from the latest stable version of
[System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/)
package, regardless of the .NET runtime version being used:

* If you are using the latest stable version of [OpenTelemetry .NET
  SDK](../../src/OpenTelemetry/README.md), you do not have to worry about the
  version of `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource` package because it is already
  taken care of for you via [package
  dependency](../../Directory.Packages.props).
* The .NET runtime team is holding a high bar for backward compatibility on
  `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource` even during major version bumps, so
  compatibility is not a concern here.
* Refer to the [.NET official
  document](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/compare-metric-apis#systemdiagnosticsmetrics)
  for more information about `System.Diagnostics.Metrics`.

## Metrics API

### Meter

:stop_sign: You should avoid creating
[`System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter)
too frequently. `Meter` is fairly expensive and meant to be reused throughout
the application. For most applications, it can be modeled as static readonly
field (e.g. [Program.cs](./getting-started-console/Program.cs)) or singleton via
dependency injection (e.g.
[Instrumentation.cs](../../examples/AspNetCore/Instrumentation.cs)).

:heavy_check_mark: You should use dot-separated
[UpperCamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) as the
[`Meter.Name`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter.name).
In many cases, using the fully qualified class name might be a good option.

```csharp
static readonly Meter MyMeter = new("MyCompany.MyProduct.MyLibrary", "1.0");
```

### Instruments

:heavy_check_mark: You should understand and pick the right instrument type.

  > [!NOTE]
  > .NET runtime has provided several instrument types based on the [OpenTelemetry
    Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument).
    Picking the right instrument type for your use case is crucial to ensure the
    correct semantics and performance. Check the [Instrument
    Selection](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/supplementary-guidelines.md#instrument-selection)
    section from the supplementary guidelines for more information.

  | OpenTelemetry Specification | .NET Instrument Type |
  | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | [Asynchronous Counter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#asynchronous-counter) | [`ObservableCounter<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.observablecounter-1) |
  | [Asynchronous Gauge](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#asynchronous-gauge) | [`ObservableGauge<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.observablegauge-1) |
  | [Asynchronous UpDownCounter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#asynchronous-updowncounter) | [`ObservableUpDownCounter<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.observableupdowncounter-1) |
  | [Counter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#counter) | [`Counter<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.counter-1) |
  | [Gauge](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#gauge) (experimental) | N/A |
  | [Histogram](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#histogram) | [`Histogram<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.histogram-1) |
  | [UpDownCounter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#updowncounter) | [`UpDownCounter<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.updowncounter-1) |

:stop_sign: You should avoid creating instruments (e.g. `Counter<T>`) too
frequently. Instruments are fairly expensive and meant to be reused throughout
the application. For most applications, instruments can be modeled as static
readonly fields (e.g. [Program.cs](./getting-started-console/Program.cs)) or
singleton via dependency injection (e.g.
[Instrumentation.cs](../../examples/AspNetCore/Instrumentation.cs)).

:stop_sign: You should avoid invalid instrument names.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenTelemetry will not collect metrics from instruments that are using invalid
  names. Refer to the [OpenTelemetry
  Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument-name-syntax)
  for the valid syntax.

:stop_sign: You should avoid changing the order of tags while reporting
measurements.

> [!WARNING]
> The last line of code has bad performance since the tags are not following
  the same order:

```csharp
counter.Add(2, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red"));
counter.Add(3, new("name", "lime"), new("color", "green"));
counter.Add(5, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow"));
counter.Add(8, new("color", "yellow"), new("name", "lemon")); // bad perf
```

:heavy_check_mark: You should use TagList properly to achieve the best
performance.

There are two different ways of passing tags to an instrument API:

* Pass the tags directly to the instrument API:

  ```csharp
  counter.Add(100, ("Key1", "Value1"), ("Key2", "Value2"));
  ```

* Use
  [`TagList`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.taglist):

  ```csharp
  var tags = new TagList
  {
      { "DimName1", "DimValue1" },
      { "DimName2", "DimValue2" },
      { "DimName3", "DimValue3" },
      { "DimName4", "DimValue4" },
  };

  counter.Add(100, tags);
  ```

Here is the rule of thumb:

* When reporting measurements with 3 tags or less, pass the tags directly to the
  instrument API.
* When reporting measurements with 4 to 8 tags (inclusive), use
  [`TagList`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.taglist?#remarks)
  to avoid heap allocation if avoiding GC pressure is a primary performance
  goal. For high performance code which consider reducing CPU utilization more
  important (e.g. to reduce latency, to save battery, etc.) than optimizing
  memory allocations, use profiler and stress test to determine which approach
  is better.
  Here are some [metrics benchmark
  results](../../test/Benchmarks/Metrics/MetricsBenchmarks.cs) for reference.
* When reporting measurements with more than 8 tags, the two approaches share
  very similar CPU performance and heap allocation. `TagList` is recommended due
  to its better readability and maintainability.

> [!NOTE]
> When reporting measurements with more than 8 tags, the API allocates memory on
  the hot code path. You SHOULD try to keep the number of tags less than or
  equal to 8. If you are exceeding this, check if you can model some of the tags
  as Resource, as [shown here](#metrics-enrichment).

## MeterProvider Management

:stop_sign: You should avoid creating `MeterProvider` instances too frequently,
`MeterProvider` is fairly expensive and meant to be reused throughout the
application. For most applications, one `MeterProvider` instance per process
would be sufficient.

```mermaid
graph LR

subgraph Meter A
  InstrumentX
end

subgraph Meter B
  InstrumentY
  InstrumentZ
end

subgraph Meter Provider 2
  MetricReader2
  MetricExporter2
  MetricReader3
  MetricExporter3
end

subgraph Meter Provider 1
  MetricReader1
  MetricExporter1
end

InstrumentX --> | Measurements | MetricReader1
InstrumentY --> | Measurements | MetricReader1 --> MetricExporter1
InstrumentZ --> | Measurements | MetricReader2 --> MetricExporter2
InstrumentZ --> | Measurements | MetricReader3 --> MetricExporter3
```

:heavy_check_mark: You should properly manage the lifecycle of `MeterProvider`
instances if they are created by you.

Here is the rule of thumb when managing the lifecycle of `MeterProvider`:

* If you are building an application with [dependency injection
  (DI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)
  (e.g. [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core) and [.NET
  Worker](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/workers)), in most
  cases you should create the `MeterProvider` instance and let DI manage its
  lifecycle. Refer to the [Getting Started with OpenTelemetry .NET Metrics in 5
  Minutes - ASP.NET Core Application](./getting-started-aspnetcore/README.md)
  tutorial to learn more.
* If you are building an application without DI, create a `MeterProvider`
  instance and manage the lifecycle explicitly. Refer to the [Getting Started
  with OpenTelemetry .NET Metrics in 5 Minutes - Console
  Application](./getting-started-console/README.md) tutorial to learn more.
* If you forget to dispose the `MeterProvider` instance before the application
  ends, metrics might get dropped due to the lack of proper flush.
* If you dispose the `MeterProvider` instance too early, any subsequent
  measurements will not be collected.

## Memory Management

In OpenTelemetry,
[measurements](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#measurement)
are reported via the metrics API. The SDK
[aggregates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#aggregation)
metrics using certain algorithms and memory management strategies to achieve
good performance and efficiency. Here are the rules which OpenTelemetry .NET
follows while implementing the metrics aggregation logic:

1. [**Pre-Aggregation**](#pre-aggregation): aggregation occurs within the SDK.
2. [**Cardinality Limits**](#cardinality-limits): the aggregation logic respects
   [cardinality
   limits](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#cardinality-limits),
   so the SDK does not use indefinite amount of memory when there is cardinality
   explosion.
3. [**Memory Preallocation**](#memory-preallocation): the memory used by
   aggregation logic is allocated during the SDK initialization, so the SDK does
   not have to allocate memory on-the-fly. This is to avoid garbage collection
   being triggered on the hot code path.

### Example

Let us take the following example:

* During the time range (T0, T1]:
  * value = 1, name = `apple`, color = `red`
  * value = 2, name = `lemon`, color = `yellow`
* During the time range (T1, T2]:
  * no fruit has been received
* During the time range (T2, T3]:
  * value = 5, name = `apple`, color = `red`
  * value = 2, name = `apple`, color = `green`
  * value = 4, name = `lemon`, color = `yellow`
  * value = 2, name = `lemon`, color = `yellow`
  * value = 1, name = `lemon`, color = `yellow`
  * value = 3, name = `lemon`, color = `yellow`

If we aggregate and export the metrics using [Cumulative Aggregation
Temporality](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#temporality):

* (T0, T1]
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `red`}, count: `1`
  * attributes: {verb = `lemon`, color = `yellow`}, count: `2`
* (T0, T2]
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `red`}, count: `1`
  * attributes: {verb = `lemon`, color = `yellow`}, count: `2`
* (T0, T3]
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `red`}, count: `6`
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `green`}, count: `2`
  * attributes: {verb = `lemon`, color = `yellow`}, count: `12`

If we aggregate and export the metrics using [Delta Aggregation
Temporality](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#temporality):

* (T0, T1]
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `red`}, count: `1`
  * attributes: {verb = `lemon`, color = `yellow`}, count: `2`
* (T1, T2]
  * nothing since we do not have any measurement received
* (T2, T3]
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `red`}, count: `5`
  * attributes: {name = `apple`, color = `green`}, count: `2`
  * attributes: {verb = `lemon`, color = `yellow`}, count: `10`

### Pre-Aggregation

Taking the [fruit example](#example), there are 6 measurements reported during
`(T2, T3]`. Instead of exporting every individual measurement event, the SDK
aggregates them and only exports the summarized results. This approach, as
illustrated in the following diagram, is called pre-aggregation:

```mermaid
graph LR

subgraph SDK
  Instrument --> | Measurements | Pre-Aggregation[Pre-Aggregation]
end

subgraph Collector
  Aggregation
end

Pre-Aggregation --> | Metrics | Aggregation
```

Pre-aggregation brings several benefits:

1. Although the amount of calculation remains the same, the amount of data
   transmitted can be significantly reduced using pre-aggregation, thus
   improving the overall efficiency.
2. Pre-aggregation makes it possible to apply [cardinality
   limits](#cardinality-limits) during SDK initialization, combined with [memory
   preallocation](#memory-preallocation), they make the metrics data collection
   behavior more predictable (e.g. a server under denial-of-service attack would
   still produce a constant volume of metrics data, rather than flooding the
   observability system with large volume of measurement events).

There are cases where users might want to export raw measurement events instead
of using pre-aggregation, as illustrated in the following diagram. OpenTelemetry
does not support this scenario at the moment, if you are interested, please join
the discussion by replying to this [feature
ask](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/617).

```mermaid
graph LR

subgraph SDK
  Instrument
end

subgraph Collector
  Aggregation
end

Instrument --> | Measurements | Aggregation
```

### Cardinality Limits

The number of unique combinations of attributes is called cardinality. Taking
the [fruit example](#example), if we know that we can only have apple/lemon as
the name, red/yellow/green as the color, then we can say the cardinality is 6.
No matter how many apples and lemons we have, we can always use the following
table to summarize the total number of fruits based on the name and color.

| Name  | Color  | Count |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| apple | red    | 6     |
| apple | yellow | 0     |
| apple | green  | 2     |
| lemon | red    | 0     |
| lemon | yellow | 12    |
| lemon | green  | 0     |

In other words, we know how much storage and network are needed to collect and
transmit these metrics, regardless of the traffic pattern.

In real world applications, the cardinality can be extremely high. Imagine if we
have a long running service and we collect metrics with 7 attributes and each
attribute can have 30 different values. We might eventually end up having to
remember the complete set of all 21,870,000,000 combinations! This cardinality
explosion is a well-known challenge in the metrics space. For example, it can
cause surprisingly high costs in the observability system, or even be leveraged
by hackers to launch a denial-of-service attack.

[Cardinality
limit](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#cardinality-limits)
is a throttling mechanism which allows the metrics collection system to have a
predictable and reliable behavior when excessive cardinality happens, whether it
was due to a malicious attack or developer making mistakes while writing code.

OpenTelemetry has a default cardinality limit of `2000` per metric. This limit
can be configured at the individual metric level using the [View
API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#view)
and the `MetricStreamConfiguration.CardinalityLimit` setting. Refer to this
[doc](../../docs/metrics/customizing-the-sdk/README.md#changing-the-cardinality-limit-for-a-metric)
for more information.

Given a metric, once the cardinality limit is reached, any new measurement which
cannot be independently aggregated because of the limit will be dropped or
aggregated using the [overflow
attribute](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#overflow-attribute)
(if enabled). When NOT using the overflow attribute feature a warning is written
to the [self-diagnostic log](../../src/OpenTelemetry/README.md#self-diagnostics)
the first time an overflow is detected for a given metric.

> [!NOTE]
> Overflow attribute was introduced in OpenTelemetry .NET
  [1.6.0-rc.1](../../src/OpenTelemetry/CHANGELOG.md#160-rc1). It is currently an
  experimental feature which can be turned on by setting the environment
  variable `OTEL_DOTNET_EXPERIMENTAL_METRICS_EMIT_OVERFLOW_ATTRIBUTE=true`. Once
  the [OpenTelemetry
  Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#overflow-attribute)
  become stable, this feature will be turned on by default.

When [Delta Aggregation
Temporality](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#temporality)
is used, it is possible to choose a smaller cardinality limit by allowing the
SDK to reclaim unused metric points.

> [!NOTE]
> Reclaim unused metric points feature was introduced in OpenTelemetry .NET
  [1.7.0-alpha.1](../../src/OpenTelemetry/CHANGELOG.md#170-alpha1). It is
  currently an experimental feature which can be turned on by setting the
  environment variable
  `OTEL_DOTNET_EXPERIMENTAL_METRICS_RECLAIM_UNUSED_METRIC_POINTS=true`. Once the
  [OpenTelemetry
  Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#overflow-attribute)
  become stable, this feature will be turned on by default.

### Memory Preallocation

OpenTelemetry .NET SDK aims to avoid memory allocation on the hot code path.
When this is combined with [proper use of Metrics API](#metrics-api), heap
allocation can be avoided on the hot code path. Refer to the [metrics benchmark
results](../../test/Benchmarks/Metrics/MetricsBenchmarks.cs) to learn more.

:heavy_check_mark: You should measure memory allocation on hot code path, and
ideally avoid any heap allocation while using the metrics API and SDK,
especially when you use metrics to measure the performance of your application
(for example, you do not want to spend 2 seconds doing [garbage
collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/)
while measuring an operation which normally takes 10 milliseconds).

## Metrics Correlation

In OpenTelemetry, metrics can be correlated to [traces](../trace/README.md) via
[exemplars](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#exemplar).
Check the [Exemplars](./exemplars/README.md) tutorial to learn more.

## Metrics Enrichment

When metrics are being collected, they normally get stored in a [time series
database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database). From storage and
consumption perspective, metrics can be multi-dimensional. Taking the [fruit
example](#example), there are two dimensions - "name" and "color". For basic
scenarios, all the dimensions can be reported during the [Metrics
API](#metrics-api) invocation, however, for less trivial scenarios, the
dimensions can come from different sources:

* [Measurements](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#measurement)
  reported via the [Metrics API](#metrics-api).
* Additional tags provided at instrument creation time. For example, the
  [`Meter.CreateCounter<T>(name, unit, description,
  tags)`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter.createcounter)
  overload.
* Additional tags provided at meter creation time. For example, the
  [`Meter(name, version, tags,
  scope)`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter.-ctor)
  overload.
* [Resources](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md)
  configured at the `MeterProvider` level. Refer to this
  [doc](./customizing-the-sdk/README.md#resource) for details and examples.
* Additional attributes provided by the exporter or collector. For example,
  [jobs and instances](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/) in
  Prometheus.

> [!NOTE]
> Instrument level tags support is not yet implemented in OpenTelemetry .NET
  since the [OpenTelemetry
  Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument)
  does not support it.

Here is the rule of thumb when modeling the dimensions:

* If the dimension is static throughout the process lifetime (e.g. the name of
  the machine, data center):
  * If the dimension applies to all metrics, model it as Resource, or even
    better, let the collector add these dimensions if feasible (e.g. a collector
    running in the same data center should know the name of the data center,
    rather than relying on / trusting each service instance to report the data
    center name).
  * If the dimension applies to a subset of metrics (e.g. the version of a
    client library), model it as meter level tags.
* If the dimension value is dynamic, report it via the [Metrics
  API](#metrics-api).

> [!NOTE]
> There were discussions around adding a new concept called
  `MeasurementProcessor`, which allows dimensions to be added to / removed from
  measurements dynamically. This idea did not get traction due to the complexity
  and performance implications, refer to this [pull
  request](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/1938)
  for more context.

## Common issues that lead to missing metrics

* The `Meter` used to create the instruments is not added to the
  `MeterProvider`. Use `AddMeter` method to enable the processing for the
  required metrics.
