# Getting Started with OpenTelemetry .NET for Metrics in 5 Minutes

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Metrics API and SDK is in alpha/experimental stage, and are not recommended for
any production use. Both the API, and SDK implementation is subject to
significant changes.

Please check the [Metric support
plan](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/1501).

## Sample usage

Check
[TestPrometheusExporter.cs](../../examples/Console/TestPrometheusExporter.cs)
for an example usage of currently implemented Metrics API/SDK along with
Prometheus exporter.
