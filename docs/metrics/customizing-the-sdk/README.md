# Customizing OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for Metrics

## MeterProvider

As shown in the [getting-started](../getting-started/README.md) doc, a valid
[`MeterProvider`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#meterprovider)
must be configured and built to collect metrics with OpenTelemetry .NET Sdk.
`MeterProvider` holds all the configuration for metrics like MetricReaders,
Views, etc. Naturally, almost all the customizations must be done on the
`MeterProvider`.

## Building a MeterProvider

Building a `MeterProvider` is done using `MeterProviderBuilder` which must be
obtained by calling `Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()`. `MeterProviderBuilder`
exposes various methods which configure the provider it is going to build. These
include methods like `AddMeter`, `AddView` etc, and are explained in subsequent
sections of this document. Once configuration is done, calling `Build()` on the
`MeterProviderBuilder` builds the `MeterProvider` instance. Once built, changes
to its configuration is not allowed. In most cases, a single `MeterProvider` is
created at the application startup, and is disposed when application shuts down.

The snippet below shows how to build a basic `MeterProvider`. This will create a
provider with default configuration, and is not particularly useful. The
subsequent sections show how to build a more useful provider.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;

using var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder().Build();
```

## MeterProvider configuration

`MeterProvider` holds the metrics configuration, which includes the following:

1. The list of `Meter`s from which instruments are created to report
   measurements.
2. The list of instrumentations enabled via [Instrumentation
   Library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/glossary.md#instrumentation-library).
3. The list of
   [MetricReaders](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#metricreader),
   including exporting readers which exports metrics to
   [Exporters](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#metricexporter)
4. The
   [Resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md)
   associated with the metrics.
5. The list of
   [Views](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#view)
   to be used.

### Meter

[`Meter`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#meter)
is used for creating
[`Instruments`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#instrument),
which are then used to report
[Measurements](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md#measurement).
The SDK follows an explicit opt-in model for listening to meters. i.e, by
default, it listens to no meters. Every meter which is used to create
instruments must be explicitly added to the meter provider.

`AddMeter` method on `MeterProviderBuilder` can be used to add a `Meter` to the
provider. The name of the `Meter` (case-insensitive) must be provided as an
argument to this method. `AddMeter` can be called multiple times to add more
than one meters. It also supports wildcard subscription model. It is important
to note that *all* the instruments from the meter will be enabled, when a
`Meter` is added. To selectively drop some instruments from a `Meter`, use the
[View](#view) feature, as shown [here](#drop-an-instrument).

It is **not** possible to add meters *once* the provider is built by the
`Build()` method on the `MeterProviderBuilder`.

The snippet below shows how to add meters to the provider.

```csharp
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;

using var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    // The following enables instruments from Meter
    // named "MyCompany.MyProduct.MyLibrary" only.
    .AddMeter("MyCompany.MyProduct.MyLibrary")
    // The following enables instruments from all Meters
    // whose name starts with  "AbcCompany.XyzProduct.".
    .AddMeter("AbcCompany.XyzProduct.*")
    .Build();
```

See [Program.cs](./Program.cs) for complete example.

**Note:** A common mistake while configuring `MeterProvider` is forgetting to
add the required `Meter`s to the provider. It is recommended to leverage the
wildcard subscription model where it makes sense. For example, if your
application is expecting to enable instruments from a number of libraries from a
company "Abc", the you can use `AddMeter("Abc.*")` to enable all meters whose
name starts with "Abc.".

### View

A
[View](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#view)
provides the ability to customize the metrics that are output by the SDK.
Following sections explains how to use this feature. Each section has two code
snippets. The first one uses an overload of `AddView` method that takes in the
name of the instrument as the first parameter. The `View` configuration is then
applied to the matching instrument name. The second code snippet shows how to
use an advanced selection criteria to achieve the same results. This requires
the user to provide a `Func<Instrument, MetricStreamConfiguration>` which offers
more flexibility in filtering the instruments to which the `View` should be
applied.

#### Rename an instrument

When SDK produces Metrics, the name of Metric is by default the name of the
instrument. View may be used to rename a metric to a different name. This is
particularly useful if there are conflicting instrument names, and you do not
own the instrument to create it with a different name.

```csharp
    // Rename an instrument to new name.
    .AddView(instrumentName: "MyCounter", name: "MyCounterRenamed")
```

```csharp
    // Advanced selection criteria and config via Func<Instrument, MetricStreamConfiguration>
    .AddView((instrument) =>
    {
        if (instrument.Meter.Name == "CompanyA.ProductB.LibraryC" &&
            instrument.Name == "MyCounter")
        {
            return new MetricStreamConfiguration() { Name = "MyCounterRenamed" };
        }

        return null;
    })
```

#### Drop an instrument

When using `AddMeter` to add a Meter to the provider, all the instruments from
that `Meter` gets subscribed. Views can be used to selectively drop an
instrument from a Meter. If the goal is to drop every instrument from a `Meter`,
then it is recommended to simply not add that `Meter` using `AddMeter`.

```csharp
    // Drop the instrument "MyCounterDrop".
    .AddView(instrumentName: "MyCounterDrop", MetricStreamConfiguration.Drop)
```

```csharp
    // Advanced selection criteria and config via Func<Instrument, MetricStreamConfiguration>
    .AddView((instrument) =>
    {
        if (instrument.Meter.Name == "CompanyA.ProductB.LibraryC" &&
            instrument.Name == "MyCounterDrop")
        {
            return MetricStreamConfiguration.Drop;
        }

        return null;
    })
```

#### Select specific tags

When recording a measurement from an instrument, all the tags that were provided
are reported as dimensions for the given metric. Views can be used to
selectively choose a subset of dimensions to report for a given metric. This is
useful when you have a metric for which only a few of the dimensions associated
with the metric are of interest to you.

```csharp
    // Only choose "name" as the dimension for the metric "MyFruitCounter"
    .AddView(
        instrumentName: "MyFruitCounter",
        metricStreamConfiguration: new MetricStreamConfiguration
        {
            TagKeys = new string[] { "name" },
        })

    ...
    // Only the dimension "name" is selected, "color" is dropped
    MyFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red"));
    MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow"));
    MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "green"));
    ...

    // If you provide an empty `string` array as `TagKeys` to the `MetricStreamConfiguration`
    // the SDK will drop all the dimensions associated with the metric
    .AddView(
        instrumentName: "MyFruitCounter",
        metricStreamConfiguration: new MetricStreamConfiguration
        {
            TagKeys = new string[] { },
        })

    ...
    // both "name" and "color" are dropped
    MyFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red"));
    MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow"));
    MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "green"));
    ...
```

```csharp
    // Advanced selection criteria and config via Func<Instrument, MetricStreamConfiguration>
    .AddView((instrument) =>
    {
        if (instrument.Meter.Name == "CompanyA.ProductB.LibraryC" &&
            instrument.Name == "MyFruitCounter")
        {
            return new MetricStreamConfiguration
            {
                TagKeys = new string[] { "name" },
            };
        }

        return null;
    })
```

#### Specify custom boundaries for Histogram

By default, the boundaries used for a Histogram are [`{ 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75,
100, 250, 500,
1000}`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#explicit-bucket-histogram-aggregation).
Views can be used to provide custom boundaries for a Histogram. The measurements
are then aggregated using the custom boundaries provided instead of the the
default boundaries. This requires the use of
`ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```csharp
    // Change Histogram boundaries to count measurements under the following buckets:
    // (-inf, 10]
    // (10, 20]
    // (20, +inf)
    .AddView(
        instrumentName: "MyHistogram",
        new ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration { Boundaries = new double[] { 10, 20 } })

    // If you provide an empty `double` array as `Boundaries` to the `ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration`,
    // the SDK will only export the sum and count for the measurements.
    // There are no buckets exported in this case.
    .AddView(
        instrumentName: "MyHistogram",
        new ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration { Boundaries = new double[] { } })
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

```csharp
    // Advanced selection criteria and config via Func<Instrument, MetricStreamConfiguration>
    .AddView((instrument) =>
    {
        if (instrument.Meter.Name == "CompanyA.ProductB.LibraryC" &&
            instrument.Name == "MyHistogram")
        {
            // `ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration` is a child class of `MetricStreamConfiguration`
            return new ExplicitBucketHistogramConfiguration
            {
                Boundaries = new double[] { 10, 20 },
            };
        }

        return null;
    })
```

**NOTE:** The SDK currently does not support any changes to `Aggregation` type
by using Views.

See [Program.cs](./Program.cs) for a complete example.

### Changing maximum Metric Streams

Every instrument results in the creation of a single Metric stream. With Views,
it is possible to produce more than one Metric stream from a single instrument.
To protect the SDK from unbounded memory usage, SDK limits the maximum number of
metric streams. All the measurements from the instruments created after reaching
this limit will be dropped. The default is 1000, and `SetMaxMetricStreams` can
be used to override the default.

Consider the below example. Here we set the maximum number of `MetricStream`s
allowed to be `1`. This means that the SDK would export measurements from only
one `MetricStream`. The very first instrument that is published
(`MyFruitCounter` in this case) will create a `MetricStream` and the SDK will
thereby reach the maximum `MetricStream` limit of `1`. The measurements from any
susequent instruments added will be dropped.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.Metrics;
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;

Counter<long> MyFruitCounter = MyMeter.CreateCounter<long>("MyFruitCounter");
Counter<long> AnotherFruitCounter = MyMeter.CreateCounter<long>("AnotherFruitCounter");

using var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddMeter("*")
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .SetMaxMetricStreams(1) // The default value is 1000
    .Build();

// SDK only exports measurements from `MyFruitCounter`.
MyFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red"));

// The measurements from `AnotherFruitCounter` are dropped as the maximum
// `MetricStream`s allowed is `1`.
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red"));
```

### Changing maximum MetricPoints per MetricStream

A Metric stream can contain as many Metric points as the number of unique
combination of keys and values. To protect the SDK from unbounded memory usage,
SDK limits the maximum number of metric points per metric stream, to a default
of 2000. Once the limit is hit, any new key/value combination for that metric is
ignored. The SDK chooses the key/value combinations in the order in which they
are emitted. `SetMaxMetricPointsPerMetricStream` can be used to override the
default.

**NOTE**: One `MetricPoint` is reserved for every `MetricStream` for the special
case where there is no key/value pair associated with the metric. The maximum
number of `MetricPoint`s has to accommodate for this special case.

Consider the below example. Here we set the maximum number of `MetricPoint`s
allowed to be `3`. This means that for every `MetricStream`, the SDK will export
measurements for up to `3` distinct key/value combinations of the metric. There
are two instruments published here: `MyFruitCounter` and `AnotherFruitCounter`.
There are two total `MetricStream`s created one for each of these instruments.
SDK will limit the maximum number of distinct key/value combinations for each of
these `MetricStream`s to `3`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics.Metrics;
using OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;

Counter<long> MyFruitCounter = MyMeter.CreateCounter<long>("MyFruitCounter");
Counter<long> AnotherFruitCounter = MyMeter.CreateCounter<long>("AnotherFruitCounter");

using var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddMeter("*")
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .SetMaxMetricPointsPerMetricStream(3) // The default value is 2000
    .Build();

// There are four distinct key/value combinations emitted for `MyFruitCounter`:
// 1. No key/value pair
// 2. (name:apple, color:red)
// 3. (name:lemon, color:yellow)
// 4. (name:apple, color:green)

// Since the maximum number of `MetricPoint`s allowed is `3`, the SDK will only export measurements for the following three combinations:
// 1. No key/value pair
// 2. (name:apple, color:red)
// 3. (name:lemon, color:yellow)

MyFruitCounter.Add(1); // Exported (No key/value pair)
MyFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red")); // Exported
MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow")); // Exported
MyFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow")); // Exported
MyFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "green")); // Not exported
MyFruitCounter.Add(5, new("name", "apple"), new("color", "red")); // Exported
MyFruitCounter.Add(4, new("name", "lemon"), new("color", "yellow")); // Exported

// There are four distinct key/value combinations emitted for `AnotherFruitCounter`:
// 1. (name:kiwi)
// 2. (name:banana, color:yellow)
// 3. (name:mango, color:yellow)
// 4. (name:banana, color:green)

// Since the maximum number of `MetricPoint`s allowed is `3`, the SDK will only export measurements for the following three combinations:
// 1. No key/value pair (This is a special case. The SDK reserves a `MetricPoint` for it even if it's not explicitly emitted.)
// 2. (name:kiwi)
// 3. (name:banana, color:yellow)

AnotherFruitCounter.Add(4, new KeyValuePair<string, object>("name", "kiwi")); // Exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "banana"), new("color", "yellow")); // Exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "mango"), new("color", "yellow")); // Not exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(1, new("name", "mango"), new("color", "yellow")); // Not exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(2, new("name", "banana"), new("color", "green")); // Not exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(5, new("name", "banana"), new("color", "yellow")); // Exported
AnotherFruitCounter.Add(4, new("name", "mango"), new("color", "yellow")); // Not exported
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

**NOTE:** The above limit is *per* metric stream, and applies to all the metric
streams. There is no ability to apply different limits for each instrument at
this moment.

### Instrumentation

// TODO

### MetricReader

[MetricReader](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#metricreader)
allows collecting the pre-aggregated metrics from the SDK. They are typically
paired with a
[MetricExporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#metricexporter)
which does the actual export of metrics.

Though `MetricReader` can be added by using the `AddReader` method on
`MeterProviderBuilder`, most users use the extension methods on
`MeterProviderBuilder` offered by exporter libraries, which adds the correct
`MetricReader`, that is configured to export metrics to the exporter.

Refer to the individual exporter docs to learn how to use them:

* [Console](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/README.md)
* [In-memory](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.InMemory/README.md)
* [OTLP](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol/README.md)
  (OpenTelemetry Protocol)
* [Prometheus](../../../src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus/README.md)
