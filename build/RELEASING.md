# Release process

**Only for Maintainers.**

 1. Decide the component(s) and tag name (version name) to be released. We use
    [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) to do versioning, which
    produces version numbers based on git tags.

    Notes:

       * There are different categories of packages. Check the project file for
         what you want to release and look for `MinVerTagPrefix`.

         * `core-`: Core packages. These packages are defined\goverened by the
           OpenTelemetry Specification or are part of fundamental infrastructure
           and have released stable versions. They may be released as `alpha`,
           `beta`, `rc`, or stable.

           * `OpenTelemetry.Api` - Defined by spec (API)
           * `OpenTelemetry.Api.ProviderBuilderExtensions` - Fundamental
             infrastructure
           * `OpenTelemetry` - Defined by spec (SDK)
           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console` - Defined by spec
           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.InMemory` - Defined by spec
           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol` - Defined by spec
           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin` - Defined by spec
           * `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting` - Fundamental infrastructure
           * `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Propagators` - Defined by spec

         * `coreunstable-`: Core unstable packages. These packages are
           defined\goverened by the OpenTelemetry Specification or are part of
           fundamental infrastructure but have not released stable versions. As
           of the `1.9.0` release cycle they may only be released as `alpha` or
           `beta`.

           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus.AspNetCore` - Defined by spec
             (experimental)
           * `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus.HttpListener` - Defined by spec
             (experimental)
           * `OpenTelemetry.Shims.OpenTracing` - Defined by spec (stable but
             incomplete implementation)

       * As of the `1.9.0` release cycle instrumentation packages and core
         unstable packages always depend on the stable versions of core
         packages. Before releasing a non-core component ensure the
         `OTelLatestStableVer` property in `Directory.Packages.props` has been
         updated to the latest stable core version.

 2. Prepare for release

    Run the [Prepare for a
    release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml)
    workflow. Specify the `tag-prefix` and the `version` for the release. Make
    sure to run the workflow on the branch being released. This is typically
    `main` but could be some other branch for hotfix (eg `main-1.8.0`). The
    workflow will open a PR to update `CHANGELOG.md` files for the projects
    being released. If a stable version is specified as the `version` parameter,
    the workflow will also merge the contents of any detected
    `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` files in the `.publicApi` folder into the
    corresponding `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` files for the projects being released.

    <summary>Instructions for preparing for a release manually</summary>

    * Update CHANGELOG files

       Run the PowerShell script `.\build\scripts\update-changelogs.ps1
       -minVerTagPrefix [MinVerTagPrefix] -version [Version]`. Where
       `[MinVerTagPrefix]` is the tag prefix (eg `core-`) for the components
       being released and `[Version]` is the version being released (eg
       `1.9.0`). This will update `CHANGELOG.md` files for the projects being
       released.

    * **Stable releases only**: Normalize PublicApi files

       Run the PowerShell script `.\build\scripts\finalize-publicapi.ps1
       -minVerTagPrefix [MinVerTagPrefix]`. Where `[MinVerTagPrefix]` is the tag
       prefix (eg `core-`) for the components being released. This will merge
       the contents of any detected `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` files in the
       `.publicApi` folder into the corresponding `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` files
       for the projects being released.

 3. :stop_sign: The PR opened by [Prepare for a
    release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml)
    workflow in step 2 has to be merged.

 4. Once the PR opened by [Prepare for a
    release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml)
    workflow in step 2 has been merged a trigger will automatically add a
    comment and lock the PR. Post a comment with "/CreateReleaseTag" in the
    body. This will tell the [Prepare for a
    release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yml)
    workflow to push the tag for the merge commit of the PR and to call the
    [Build, pack, and publish to
    MyGet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/publish-packages-1.0.yml)
    workflow. Once packages are available a comment will be posted on the PR
    opened in step 2 with a link to the artifacts.

    <details>
    <summary>Instructions for pushing tags manually</summary>

    Note: In the below examples `git push origin` is used. If running in a fork,
    add the main repo as `upstream` and use `git push upstream` instead. Pushing
    a tag to `origin` in a fork pushes the tag to the fork.

    * If releasing core components, add and push the tag prefixed with `core-`.
    For example:

       ```sh
       git tag -a core-1.4.0-beta.1 -m "1.4.0-beta.1 of all core components"
       git push origin core-1.4.0-beta.1
       ```

    * If releasing core unstable components, push the tag prefixed with
    `coreunstable-`. For example:

       ```sh
       git tag -a coreunstable-1.9.0-beta.1 -m "1.9.0-beta.1 of all core unstable components"
       git push origin coreunstable-1.9.0-beta.1
       ```

    Pushing the tag will kick off the [Build, pack, and publish to
    MyGet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/publish-packages-1.0.yml)
    workflow.

 5. :stop_sign: Wait for the [Build, pack, and publish to
    MyGet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/publish-packages-1.0.yml)
    workflow to complete.

 6. Validate locally everything works using the MyGet packages pushed from the
    release. Basic sanity checks :)

 7. Download the artifacts from the drop attached to the workflow run. The
    artifacts archive (`.zip`) contains all the NuGet packages (`.nupkg`) and
    symbols (`.snupkg`) from the build which were pushed to MyGet.

 8. Extract the artifacts from the archive (`.zip`) into a local folder.

 9. Download latest [nuget.exe](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) into the same
    folder from Step 8.

10. Create or regenerate an API key from nuget.org (only maintainers have
    access). When creating API keys make sure it is set to expire in 1 day or
    less.

11. Run the following commands from PowerShell from local folder used in Step 8:

    ```powershell
    .\nuget.exe setApiKey <actual api key>

    get-childitem -Recurse | where {$_.extension -eq ".nupkg"} | foreach ($_) {.\nuget.exe push $_.fullname -Source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json}
    ```

12. Validate that the package(s) are uploaded. Packages are available
    immediately to maintainers on nuget.org but aren't publicly visible until
    scanning completes. This process usually takes a few minutes.

13. Open the
    [Releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/releases)
    page on the GitHub repository. The [Build, pack, and publish to
    MyGet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/publish-packages-1.0.yml)
    workflow creates a draft release for the tag which was pushed. Edit the
    draft Release and click `Publish release`.

14. If a new stable version of the core packages was released, a draft PR should
    have been automatically created by the [Build, pack, and publish to
    MyGet](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/actions/workflows/publish-packages-1.0.yml)
    workflow to update the `OTelLatestStableVer` property in
    `Directory.Packages.props` to the just released stable version. Mark that PR
    `Ready for review` and then merge it once the build passes (this requires
    the packages be available on NuGet).

15. If a new stable version of the core packages was released, open an issue in
    the
    [opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib)
    repo to notify maintainers to begin upgrading dependencies.

16. Post an announcement in the [Slack
    channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N3BC2W7Q). Note any big
    or interesting new features as part of the announcement.
