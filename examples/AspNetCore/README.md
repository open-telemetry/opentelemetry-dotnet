# OpenTelemetry ASP.Net Core 6  Web API Example

This example uses the new WebApplication host that ships with .Net 6
and shows how to setup

1. OpenTelemetry logging
2. OpenTelemetry metrics
3. OpenTelemetry tracing

`ResourceBuilder` is associated with OpenTelemetry to associate the
service name, version and the machine on which this program is running.

The sample rate is set to emit all the traces using `AlwaysOnSampler`.
You can try out different samplers like `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler`.
