# LoggingTracer

This is supposed to be a super-simple API implementation that helps to understand OpenTelemetry API layer. It is not a functional tracer in the sense that it creates meaningful spans. It just logs API calls.

It basically just logs every single API call, with thread-id and a time-offset since start.
