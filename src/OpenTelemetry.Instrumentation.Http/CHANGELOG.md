# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.5.1-beta.1

Released 2023-Jul-20

* The new HTTP and network semantic conventions can be opted in to by setting
  the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This allows for a
  transition period for users to experiment with the new semantic conventions
  and adapt as necessary. The environment variable supports the following
  values:
  * `http` - emit the new, frozen (proposed for stable) HTTP and networking
  attributes, and stop emitting the old experimental HTTP and networking
  attributes that the instrumentation emitted previously.
  * `http/dup` - emit both the old and the frozen (proposed for stable) HTTP
  and networking attributes, allowing for a more seamless transition.
  * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
  emitting the same HTTP and network semantic conventions that were emitted in
  `1.5.0-beta.1`.
  * Note: this option will eventually be removed after the new HTTP and
  network semantic conventions are marked stable. At which time this
  instrumentation can receive a stable release, and the old HTTP and
  network semantic conventions will no longer be supported. Refer to the
  specification for more information regarding the new HTTP and network
  semantic conventions for both
  [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.21.0/docs/http/http-spans.md)
  and
  [metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.21.0/docs/http/http-metrics.md).

## 1.5.0-beta.1

Released 2023-Jun-05

* Bumped the package version to `1.5.0-beta.1` to keep its major and minor
  version in sync with that of the core packages. This would make it more
  intuitive for users to figure out what version of core packages would work
  with a given version of this package. The pre-release identifier has also been
  changed from `rc` to `beta` as we believe this more accurately reflects the
  status of this package. We believe the `rc` identifier will be more
  appropriate as semantic conventions reach stability.

* Fixed an issue of missing `http.client.duration` metric data in case of
  network failures (when response is not available).
  ([#4098](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/4098))

* Improve perf by avoiding boxing of common status codes values.
  ([#4361](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/4361),
  [#4363](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/4363))

## 1.0.0-rc9.14

Released 2023-Feb-24

* Updated OTel SDK dependency to 1.4.0

## 1.4.0-rc9.13

Released 2023-Feb-10

## 1.0.0-rc9.12

Released 2023-Feb-01

## 1.0.0-rc9.11

Released 2023-Jan-09

## 1.0.0-rc9.10

Released 2022-Dec-12

* Added `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` as dimensions on
  `http.client.duration` metric.
  ([#3907](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3907))

* **Breaking change** `http.host` will no longer be populated on activity.
  `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` attributes will be populated instead.
  ([#3832](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3832))

## 1.0.0-rc9.9

Released 2022-Nov-07

* Added back `netstandard2.0` target.
  ([#3787](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3787))

* **Breaking change**: The `Enrich` callback option has been removed. For better
  usability, it has been replaced by three separate options: In case of
  `HttpClient` the new options are `EnrichWithHttpRequestMessage`,
  `EnrichWithHttpResponseMessage` and `EnrichWithException` and in case of
  `HttpWebRequest` the new options are `EnrichWithHttpWebRequest`,
  `EnrichWithHttpWebResponse` and `EnrichWithException`. Previously, the single
  `Enrich` callback required the consumer to detect which event triggered the
  callback to be invoked (e.g., request start, response end, or an exception)
  and then cast the object received to the appropriate type:
  `HttpRequestMessage`, `HttpResponsemessage`, or `Exception` in case of
  `HttpClient` and `HttpWebRequest`,`HttpWebResponse` and `Exception` in case of
  `HttpWebRequest`. The separate callbacks make it clear what event triggers
  them and there is no longer the need to cast the argument to the expected
  type.
  ([#3792](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3792))

* Fixed an issue which prevented custom propagators from being called on .NET 7+
  runtimes for non-sampled outgoing `HttpClient` spans.
  ([#3828](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3828))

* **Breaking change**: The same API is now exposed for `net462` and
  `netstandard2.0` targets. The `Filter` property on options is now exposed as
  `FilterHttpRequestMessage` (called for .NET & .NET Core) and
  `FilterHttpWebRequest` (called for .NET Framework).
  ([#3793](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3793))

## 1.0.0-rc9.8

Released 2022-Oct-17

* In case of .NET Core, additional spans created during retries will now be
exported.
([[#3729](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/3729)])

## 1.0.0-rc9.7

Released 2022-Sep-29

* Dropped `netstandard2.0` target and added `net6.0`. .NET 5 reached EOL
  in May 2022 and .NET Core 3.1 reaches EOL in December 2022. End of support
  dates for .NET are published
  [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
  The instrumentation for HttpClient now requires .NET 6 or later.
  This does not affect applications targeting .NET Framework.
  ([#3664](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3664))

* Added overloads which accept a name to the `TracerProviderBuilder`
  `AddHttpClientInstrumentation` extension to allow for more fine-grained
  options management
  ([#3664](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3664),
  [#3667](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3667))

  ([#3555](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/3555))

* Changed activity source name from `OpenTelemetry.HttpWebRequest`
  to `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http.HttpWebRequest` for `HttpWebRequest`s
  and from `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`
  to `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http.HttpClient` for `HttpClient`.

  now always automatically populated.
  To remove this tag, set "http.flavor" to null using `ActivityProcessor`.
  ([#3380](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/3380))

* Fix `Enrich` not getting invoked when SocketException due to HostNotFound
  occurs.

## 0.8.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Nov-5

* Instrumentation for `HttpWebRequest` no longer store raw objects like
  `HttpWebRequest` in Activity.CustomProperty. To enrich activity, use the
  Enrich action on the instrumentation.
  ([#1407](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1407))
* Renamed TextMapPropagator to TraceContextPropagator, CompositePropagator to
  CompositeTextMapPropagator. IPropagator is renamed to TextMapPropagator and
  changed from interface to abstract class.
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1427))
* Propagators.DefaultTextMapPropagator will be used as the default Propagator
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1428))

  respect the Propagator.DefaultTextMapPropagator.
  ([#1448](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1448))

## 0.7.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Oct-16

  Response, and/or Exception objects to the Activity it creates
  ([#1099](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1099))
* Changed the default propagation to support W3C Baggage
  ([#1048](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1048))
  * The default ITextFormat is now `CompositePropagator(TraceContextFormat,
    BaggageFormat)`. Outgoing Http request will now send Baggage using the [W3C
    Baggage](https://github.com/w3c/baggage/blob/master/baggage/HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT.md)
    header. Previously Baggage was sent using the `Correlation-Context` header,
    which is now outdated.
* Removed `AddHttpInstrumentation` and `AddHttpWebRequestInstrumentation` (.NET
  Framework) `TracerProviderBuilderExtensions`. `AddHttpClientInstrumentation`
  will now register `HttpClient` instrumentation on .NET Core and `HttpClient` +
  `HttpWebRequest` instrumentation on .NET Framework.
