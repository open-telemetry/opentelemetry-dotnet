  Activity before any enrichment done by the instrumentation.
  ([#1836](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1836))
* Performance optimization by leveraging sampling decision and short circuiting
  activity enrichment.
  ([#1894](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1894))

## 1.0.0-rc2

Released 2021-Jan-29

* `otel.status_description` tag will no longer be set to the http status

## 0.8.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Nov-5

* Instrumentation for `HttpWebRequest` no longer store raw objects like
  `HttpWebRequest` in Activity.CustomProperty. To enrich activity, use the
  Enrich action on the instrumentation.
  ([#1407](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1407))
* Renamed TextMapPropagator to TraceContextPropagator, CompositePropapagor to
  CompositeTextMapPropagator. IPropagator is renamed to TextMapPropagator and
  changed from interface to abstract class.
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1427))
* Propagators.DefaultTextMapPropagator will be used as the default Propagator
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1428))
* Removed Propagator from Instrumentation Options. Instrumentation now always
  respect the Propagator.DefaultTextMapPropagator.
  ([#1448](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1448))

## 0.7.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Oct-16

* Instrumentation no longer store raw objects like `HttpRequestMessage` in
  Activity.CustomProperty. To enrich activity, use the Enrich action on the
  instrumentation.
  ([#1261](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1261))
* Span Status is populated as per new spec
  ([#1313](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1313))

## 0.6.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Sep-15

## 0.5.0-beta.2

Released 2020-08-28

* Rename FilterFunc to Filter.

* HttpClient/HttpWebRequest instrumentation will now add the raw Request,
  Response, and/or Exception objects to the Activity it creates
  ([#1099](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1099))
* Changed the default propagation to support W3C Baggage
  ([#1048](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1048))
  * The default ITextFormat is now `CompositePropagator(TraceContextFormat,
    BaggageFormat)`. Outgoing Http request will now send Baggage using the [W3C
    Baggage](https://github.com/w3c/baggage/blob/master/baggage/HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT.md)
    header. Previously Baggage was sent using the `Correlation-Context` header,
    which is now outdated.
* Removed `AddHttpInstrumentation` and `AddHttpWebRequestInstrumentation` (.NET
  Framework) `TracerProviderBuilderExtensions`. `AddHttpClientInstrumentation`
  will now register `HttpClient` instrumentation on .NET Core and `HttpClient` +
  `HttpWebRequest` instrumentation on .NET Framework.
* Renamed `ITextPropagator` to `IPropagator`
  ([#1190](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1190))
