## Introduction

OpenTelemetry SDK is a reference implementation of the OpenTelemetry API. It
implements the Logging API, Metrics API, Tracing API, Resource API, and the
Context API. Once a valid SDK is installed and configured all the OpenTelemetry
API methods, which were no-ops without an SDK, will start emitting telemetry.
This SDK also ships with an [ILogger integration](#ilogger-integration).

The SDK deals with concerns such as sampling, processing pipelines (exporting
telemetry to a particular backend, etc.), metrics aggregation, and other
concerns outlined in the [OpenTelemetry
Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).
In most cases, users indirectly install and enable the SDK when they install an
exporter.

## Getting started

For general information about how to initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK see
[getting started](../../docs//README.md).

### Getting started with Logging

If you are new to
[logging](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/README.md),
it is recommended to first follow the [getting started in 5 minutes - ASP.NET
Core Application](../../docs/logs/getting-started-aspnetcore/README.md) guide or
the [getting started in 5 minutes - Console
Application](../../docs/logs/getting-started-console/README.md) guide to get up
and running.

For a more detailed explanation of SDK logging features see [Customizing
OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for Logs](../../docs/logs/customizing-the-sdk/README.md).

#### ILogger integration

This repo ships an
[ILoggerProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging-providers)
implementation which automatically enriches logs emitted using
[ILogger](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging) with trace
correlation information (`ActivityContext`).

### Getting started with Metrics

If you are new to
[metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/README.md),
it is recommended to first follow the [getting started in 5 minutes - ASP.NET
Core Application](../../docs/metrics/getting-started-aspnetcore/README.md) guide
or the [getting started in 5 minutes - Console
Application](../../docs/metrics/getting-started-console/README.md) guide to get
up and running.

For a more detailed explanation of SDK metric features see [Customizing
OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for
Metrics](../../docs/metrics/customizing-the-sdk/README.md).

### Getting started with Tracing

If you are new to
[traces](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/README.md),
it is recommended to first follow the [getting started in 5 minutes - ASP.NET
Core Application](../../docs/trace/getting-started-aspnetcore/README.md) guide
or the [getting started in 5 minutes - Console
Application](../../docs/trace/getting-started-console/README.md) guide to get up
and running.

For a more detailed explanation of SDK tracing features see [Customizing
OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for
Tracing](../../docs/trace/customizing-the-sdk/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

All the components shipped from this repo uses
[EventSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource)
for its internal logging. The name of the `EventSource` used by OpenTelemetry
SDK is "OpenTelemetry-Sdk". To know the `EventSource` names used by other
components, refer to the individual readme files.

While it is possible to view these logs using tools such as
[PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview),
[dotnet-trace](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace)
etc., this SDK also ships a [self-diagnostics](#self-diagnostics) feature, which
helps troubleshooting.

## Self-diagnostics

OpenTelemetry SDK ships with built-in self-diagnostics feature. This feature,
when enabled, will listen to internal logs generated by all OpenTelemetry
components (i.e EventSources whose name starts with "OpenTelemetry-") and writes
them to a log file.

The self-diagnostics feature can be enabled/changed/disabled while the process
is running (without restarting the process). The SDK will attempt to read the
configuration file every `10` seconds in non-exclusive read-only mode. The SDK
will create or overwrite a file with new logs according to the configuration.
This file will not exceed the configured max size and will be overwritten in a
circular way.

To enable self-diagnostics, go to the
[current working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) of
your process and create a configuration file named `OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS.json` with
the following content:

```json
{
    "LogDirectory": ".",
    "FileSize": 32768,
    "LogLevel": "Warning"
}
```

To disable self-diagnostics, delete the above file.

Tip: In most cases, you could just drop the file along your application.
On Windows, you can use [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer),
double click on the process to pop up Properties dialog and find "Current
directory" in "Image" tab.
Internally, it looks for the configuration file located in
[GetCurrentDirectory](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.getcurrentdirectory),
and then [AppContext.BaseDirectory](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.appcontext.basedirectory).
You can also find the exact directory by calling these methods from your code.

### Configuration Parameters

1. `LogDirectory` is the directory where the output log file will be stored. It
   can be an absolute path or a relative path to the current directory.

2. `FileSize` is a positive integer, which specifies the log file size in
   [KiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte). This value must be within
   range `[1024, 131072]` (1 MiB \<= size \<= 128 MiB), or it will be rounded to
   the closest upper or lower limit. The log file will never exceed this
   configured size, and will be overwritten in a circular way.

3. `LogLevel` is the lowest level of the events to be captured. It has to be one
   of the
   [values](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlevel#fields)
   of the [`EventLevel`
   enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlevel).
   The level signifies the severity of an event. Lower severity levels encompass
   higher severity levels. For example, `Warning` includes the `Error` and
   `Critical` levels.

### Remarks

A `FileSize`-KiB log file named as `ExecutableName.ProcessId.log` (e.g.
`foobar.exe.12345.log`) will be generated at the specified directory
`LogDirectory`, into which logs are written to.

If the SDK fails to parse the `LogDirectory`, `FileSize` or `LogLevel` fields as
the specified format, the configuration file will be treated as invalid and no
log file would be generated.

When the `LogDirectory` or `FileSize` is found to be changed, the SDK will create
or overwrite a file with new logs according to the new configuration. The
configuration file has to be no more than 4 KiB. In case the file is larger than
4 KiB, only the first 4 KiB of content will be read.

The log file might not be a proper text file format to achieve the goal of having
minimal overhead and bounded resource usage: it may have trailing `NUL`s if log
text is less than configured size; once write operation reaches the end, it will
start from beginning and overwrite existing text.
