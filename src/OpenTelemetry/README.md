## Installation

dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
```

## Introduction

OpenTelemetry SDK is a reference implementation of the OpenTelemetry API. It
implements the Logging API, Metrics API, Tracing API, Resource API, and the
Context API. Once a valid SDK is installed and configured all the OpenTelemetry
API methods, which were no-ops without an SDK, will start emitting telemetry.
This SDK also ships with
[ILogger](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logging)
integration to automatically capture and enrich logs emitted using
`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`.

The SDK deals with concerns such as sampling, processing pipelines (exporting
telemetry to a particular backend, etc.), metrics aggregation, and other
concerns outlined in the [OpenTelemetry
Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).
In most cases, users indirectly install and enable the SDK when they install an
exporter.

To learn how to set up and configure the OpenTelemetry SDK see: [Getting
started](../../README.md#getting-started). For additional details about
initialization patterns see: [Initialize the
SDK](../../docs/README.md#initialize-the-sdk).

## Troubleshooting

All the components shipped from this repo uses
[EventSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource)
for its internal logging. The name of the `EventSource` used by OpenTelemetry
SDK is "OpenTelemetry-Sdk". To know the `EventSource` names used by other
components, refer to the individual readme files.

While it is possible to view these logs using tools such as
[PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview),
[dotnet-trace](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace)
etc., this SDK also ships a [self-diagnostics](#self-diagnostics) feature, which
helps with troubleshooting.

### Self-diagnostics

OpenTelemetry SDK ships with built-in self-diagnostics feature. This feature,
when enabled, will listen to internal logs generated by all OpenTelemetry
components (i.e EventSources whose name starts with "OpenTelemetry-") and writes
them to a log file.

The self-diagnostics feature can be enabled/changed/disabled while the process
is running (without restarting the process). The SDK will attempt to read the
configuration file every `10` seconds in non-exclusive read-only mode. The SDK
will create or overwrite a file with new logs according to the configuration.
This file will not exceed the configured max size and will be overwritten in a
circular way.

To enable self-diagnostics, go to the
[current working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) of
your process and create a configuration file named `OTEL_DIAGNOSTICS.json` with
the following content:

```json
{
    "LogDirectory": ".",
    "FileSize": 32768,
    "LogLevel": "Warning"
}
```

To disable self-diagnostics, delete the above file.

Tip: In most cases, you could just drop the file along your application.
On Windows, you can use [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer),
double click on the process to pop up Properties dialog and find "Current
directory" in "Image" tab.
Internally, it looks for the configuration file located in
[GetCurrentDirectory](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.getcurrentdirectory),
and then [AppContext.BaseDirectory](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.appcontext.basedirectory).
You can also find the exact directory by calling these methods from your code.

#### Configuration Parameters

1. `LogDirectory` is the directory where the output log file will be stored. It
   can be an absolute path or a relative path to the current directory.

2. `FileSize` is a positive integer, which specifies the log file size in
   [KiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte). This value must be within
   range `[1024, 131072]` (1 MiB \<= size \<= 128 MiB), or it will be rounded to
   the closest upper or lower limit. The log file will never exceed this
   configured size, and will be overwritten in a circular way.

3. `LogLevel` is the lowest level of the events to be captured. It has to be one
   of the
   [values](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlevel#fields)
   of the [`EventLevel`
   enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlevel).
   The level signifies the severity of an event. Lower severity levels encompass
   higher severity levels. For example, `Warning` includes the `Error` and
   `Critical` levels.

#### Remarks

A `FileSize`-KiB log file named as `ExecutableName.ProcessId.log` (e.g.
`foobar.exe.12345.log`) will be generated at the specified directory
`LogDirectory`, into which logs are written to.

If the SDK fails to parse the `LogDirectory`, `FileSize` or `LogLevel` fields as
the specified format, the configuration file will be treated as invalid and no
log file would be generated.

When the `LogDirectory` or `FileSize` is found to be changed, the SDK will create
or overwrite a file with new logs according to the new configuration. The
configuration file has to be no more than 4 KiB. In case the file is larger than
4 KiB, only the first 4 KiB of content will be read.

The log file might not be a proper text file format to achieve the goal of having
minimal overhead and bounded resource usage: it may have trailing `NUL`s if log
text is less than configured size; once write operation reaches the end, it will
start from beginning and overwrite existing text.

## Example output

```txt
If you are seeing this message, it means that the OpenTelemetry SDK has successfully created the log file used to write self-diagnostic logs. This file will be appended with logs as they appear. If you do not see any logs following this line, it means no logs of the configured LogLevel is occurring. You may change the LogLevel to show lower log levels, so that logs of lower severities will be shown.
