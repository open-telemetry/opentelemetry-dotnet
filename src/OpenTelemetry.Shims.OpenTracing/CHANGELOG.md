# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Fix: Do not raise `ArgumentException` if `Activity` behind the shim span
  has an invalid context.
  ([#2787](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/2787))

## 1.5.0-beta.1

Released 2023-Jun-05

* Bumped the package version to `1.5.0-beta.1` to keep its major and minor
  version in sync with that of the core packages. This would make it more
  intuitive for users to figure out what version of core packages would work
  with a given version of this package. The pre-release identifier has also been
  changed from `rc` to `beta` as we believe this more accurately reflects the
  status of this package. We believe the `rc` identifier will be more
  appropriate as semantic conventions reach stability.
