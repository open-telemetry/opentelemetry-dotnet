# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.0.0-rc8

Released 2021-Oct-08

* Replaced `http.path` tag on activity with `http.target`.
  ([#2266](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/2266))

## 1.0.0-rc7

Released 2021-Jul-12

## 1.0.0-rc6

Released 2021-Jun-25

## 1.0.0-rc5

Released 2021-Jun-09

* Fixes bug
  [#1740](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/1740):
  Instrumentation.AspNetCore for gRPC services omits ALL rpc.* attributes under
  certain conditions
  ([#1879](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1879))

## 1.0.0-rc4

Released 2021-Apr-23

* When using OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting you can now bind
  `AspNetCoreInstrumentationOptions` from DI.
  ([#1997](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1997))

## 1.0.0-rc3

Released 2021-Mar-19

* Leverages added AddLegacySource API from OpenTelemetry SDK to trigger Samplers
  and ActivityProcessors. Samplers, ActivityProcessor.OnStart will now get the
  Activity before any enrichment done by the instrumentation.
  ([#1836](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1836))
* Performance optimization by leveraging sampling decision and short circuiting
  activity enrichment. `Filter` and `Enrich` are now only called if
  `activity.IsAllDataRequested` is `true`
  ([#1899](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1899))

## 1.0.0-rc2

Released 2021-Jan-29

## 1.0.0-rc1.1

Released 2020-Nov-17

* AspNetCoreInstrumentation sets ActivitySource to activities created outside
  ActivitySource.
  ([#1515](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1515/))
* For gRPC invocations, leading forward slash is trimmed from span name in order
  to conform to the specification.
  ([#1551](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1551))

## 0.8.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Nov-5

* Record `Exception` in AspNetCore instrumentation based on `RecordException` in
  `AspNetCoreInstrumentationOptions`
  ([#1408](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/1408))
* Added configuration option `EnableGrpcAspNetCoreSupport` to enable or disable
  support for adding OpenTelemetry RPC attributes when using
  [Grpc.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.AspNetCore/). This
  option is enabled by default.
  ([#1423](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1423))
* Renamed TextMapPropagator to TraceContextPropagator, CompositePropapagor to
  CompositeTextMapPropagator. IPropagator is renamed to TextMapPropagator and
  changed from interface to abstract class.
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1427))
* Propagators.DefaultTextMapPropagator will be used as the default Propagator
  ([#1427](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1428))
* Removed Propagator from Instrumentation Options. Instrumentation now always
  respect the Propagator.DefaultTextMapPropagator.
  ([#1448](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1448))

## 0.7.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Oct-16

* Instrumentation no longer store raw objects like `HttpRequest` in
  Activity.CustomProperty. To enrich activity, use the Enrich action on the
  instrumentation.
  ([#1261](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1261))
* Span Status is populated as per new spec
  ([#1313](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1313))

## 0.6.0-beta.1

Released 2020-Sep-15

* For gRPC invocations, the `grpc.method` and `grpc.status_code` attributes
  added by the library are removed from the span. The information from these
  attributes is contained in other attributes that follow the conventions of
  OpenTelemetry.
  ([#1260](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1260)).

## 0.5.0-beta.2

Released 2020-08-28

* Added Filter public API on AspNetCoreInstrumentationOptions to allow filtering
  of instrumentation based on HttpContext.

* Asp.Net Core Instrumentation automatically populates HttpRequest, HttpResponse
  in Activity custom property

* Changed the default propagation to support W3C Baggage
  ([#1048](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1048))
  * The default ITextFormat is now `CompositePropagator(TraceContextFormat,
    BaggageFormat)`. Baggage sent via the [W3C
    Baggage](https://github.com/w3c/baggage/blob/master/baggage/HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT.md)
    header will now be parsed and set on incoming Http spans.
* Introduced support for Grpc.AspNetCore (#803).
  * Attributes are added to gRPC invocations: `rpc.system`, `rpc.service`,
    `rpc.method`. These attributes are added to an existing span generated by
    the instrumentation. This is unlike the instrumentation for client-side gRPC
    calls where one span is created for the gRPC call and a separate span is
    created for the underlying HTTP call in the event both gRPC and HTTP
    instrumentation are enabled.
* Renamed `ITextPropagator` to `IPropagator`
  ([#1190](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1190))

## 0.4.0-beta.2
