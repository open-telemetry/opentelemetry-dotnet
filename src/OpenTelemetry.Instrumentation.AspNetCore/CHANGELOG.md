# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Changed the default propagation to support W3C Baggage
  ([#1048](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/pull/1048))
  * The default ITextFormat is now `CompositePropagator(TraceContextFormat,
    BaggageFormat)`. Baggage sent via the [W3C
    Baggage](https://github.com/w3c/baggage/blob/master/baggage/HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT.md)
    header will now be parsed and set on incoming Http spans.
* Introduced support for Grpc.AspNetCore (#803).
  * Attributes are added to gRPC invocations: `rpc.system`, `rpc.service`,
    `rpc.method`. These attributes are added to an existing span generated by
    the instrumentation. This is unlike the instrumentation for client-side gRPC
    calls where one span is created for the gRPC call and a separate span is
    created for the underlying HTTP call in the event both gRPC and HTTP
    instrumentation are enabled.
