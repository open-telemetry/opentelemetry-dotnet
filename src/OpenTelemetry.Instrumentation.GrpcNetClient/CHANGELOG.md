## Unreleased

## 1.5.1-beta.1

Released 2023-Jul-20

* The new network semantic conventions can be opted in to by setting
  the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This allows for a
  transition period for users to experiment with the new semantic conventions
  and adapt as necessary. The environment variable supports the following
  values:
  * `http` - emit the new, frozen (proposed for stable) networking
  attributes, and stop emitting the old experimental networking
  attributes that the instrumentation emitted previously.
  * `http/dup` - emit both the old and the frozen (proposed for stable)
  networking attributes, allowing for a more seamless transition.
  * The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
  emitting the same network semantic conventions that were emitted in
  `1.5.0-beta.1`.
  * Note: this option will eventually be removed after the new
  network semantic conventions are marked stable. Refer to the
  specification for more information regarding the new network
  semantic conventions for
  [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.21.0/docs/rpc/rpc-spans.md).

## 1.5.0-beta.1

Released 2023-Jun-05

* Bumped the package version to `1.5.0-beta.1` to keep its major and minor
  version in sync with that of the core packages. This would make it more
  intuitive for users to figure out what version of core packages would work
  with a given version of this package. The pre-release identifier has also been
  changed from `rc` to `beta` as we believe this more accurately reflects the
  status of this package. We believe the `rc` identifier will be more
  appropriate as semantic conventions reach stability.

## 1.0.0-rc9.9

Released 2022-Nov-07

 **Breaking change** The `Enrich` callback option has been removed. For better
  usability, it has been replaced by two separate options:
  `EnrichWithHttpRequestMessage`and `EnrichWithHttpResponseMessage`. Previously,
  the single `Enrich` callback required the consumer to detect which event
  triggered the callback to be invoked (e.g., request start or response end) and
  then cast the object received to the appropriate type: `HttpRequestMessage`
  and `HttpResponseMessage`. The separate callbacks make it clear what event
  triggers them and there is no longer the need to cast the argument to the
  expected type.

  activity enrichment.
