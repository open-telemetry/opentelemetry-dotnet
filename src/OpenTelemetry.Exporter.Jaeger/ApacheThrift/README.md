# Open Telemetry - Jaeger Exporter - Apache Thrift 

This folder contains a stripped-down fork of the [ApacheThrift 0.13.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ApacheThrift/0.13.0.1) library from the [apache/thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/0.13.0) repo. Only the client bits we need to transmit spans to Jaeger using the compact Thrift protocol over UDP are included. Removing the other stuff (mainly the server bits) allowed us to also remove all of the dependencies ApacheThrift requires with the exception of `System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions` (needed for .NET Standard 2.0 target only).

This was done because the official NuGet has two issues:

* The .NET Standard 2.0 target requires `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Abstractions (>= 2.2.0)` which forces Jaeger consumers to use at least .NET Core 2.2+. We wanted to support at least .NET Core 2.1 which is the LTS version.
* The nupkg contains a net45 library with a different API than the .NET Standard 2.0 library. This breaks .NET Framework consumers of OpenTelemetry using Jaeger unless we force selection of the lib/netstandard2.0 reference instead.

Ideally we would consume the official package but these issues made it difficult.

Changes:

* Everything made internal.
* Added https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2093.
* Added https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2057.

Other than those changes, files included are in their entirety. Meaning, if we used anything out of a .cs file in the Thrift repo, the whole file was included. For example, in `TCompactProtocol` there are a bunch of "Read" operations. We don't use those, but they were left in.
